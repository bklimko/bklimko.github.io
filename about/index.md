title: About me
---

I am both a practicing engineer and a student. 

After earning a BSEE with specialization in photonics, electronics, and nano-devices and MEE with a focus on communication systems and signal processing, both from Rice University in Houston, Texas, I joined the technical staff at the Johns Hopkins University [Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/). As a communications engineer there, I work on critical networking and signal processing challenges requiring creative solutions across the RF and optical domains. 

As a part-time student at the University of Maryland, College Park, I am a researcher in Professor Yanne Chembo's [lab](https://chembolab.umd.edu/) where I study the use of photonic reservoirs for classifying modulation schemes.

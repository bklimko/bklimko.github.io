title: About me
---

I am both a practicing engineer and a student.  

I earned a BSEE with a specialization in photonics from Rice University in Houston, Texas. The senior design team I was a member of [received attention](https://news2.rice.edu/2019/04/23/students-hope-to-cut-ties-that-bind-seizure-sufferers-2/) for our work on a wireless neural recorder that went on [to win](https://www.tmc.edu/news/2019/05/rice-students-wireless-epilepsy-monitor-wins-in-japan%E2%80%A8/) the international [IEEE Circuits and Systems Society Student Design Competition](https://ieee-cas.org/2018-2019-cass-student-design-competition-world-and-regional-winners) in Sapporo, Japan. I then received my MEE, also from Rice, with a focus on communication systems and signal processing.  

I then joined the technical staff at the Johns Hopkins University [Applied Physics Lab](https://www.jhuapl.edu/) where, as a communications engineer, I work on critical networking and signal processing challenges requiring creative solutions across the RF and optical domains.  

As a part-time student at the University of Maryland, College Park, I am a researcher in Professor Yanne Chembo's [lab](https://chembolab.umd.edu/) where I study the use of photonic reservoirs for classifying RF modulation schemes.
